--- EDIT: It's now responsive and should work well all around--- 

Made for 4th Community Challenge over at http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/2f97yk/community_challenge_design_a_link_page/

Icons used- http://ionicons.com (I couldn't find all of the code-language icons as a webfont, so I had to edit them and use them as images.)
